Are you ready to read some boring text?)

I was born in Ukraine. For now, live and work in Ukraine also. Fortuity?

I had started working on site from school. I was forced to start me on site for the contest, but with time I liked it. That started my history.

At university, I was started working on a small company to write a site. It was `CTRL+C` - `CTRL+V` job, but I want to bigger.
That's why I started searching for a new job. A new home for me. I've changed a lot of works and now I also looking for the place where I can work all my life. But in different works, I had seen many people that inspire me to do bigger and bigger for me and my job. I'll always be thankful to them.
